Hello there
# Assignment 6

### How did i do this funny buisniess?
I was planning to use gradle, but i had issues with setting up the project in WSL. As the IDE was pointing to a path in normal windows when trying to build the project and WSL didn't reccognize it. In windows i had some issues running gradle too.

So i found out there were tutorials for other languages too. I first tried Haskell, but the example was made with Stack and i had been using GHCUP / CABAL up to this point and didn't wanna set up a different kinda enviroment. So i just defaulted to python. There was a tutorial with just as much info as the JAVA one so i just followed that one.

### Code monkey
code is in the same directory as this

### What have i done??
I ran / installed / set up RabbitMQ using docker on WSL and completed tutorials 1-3 as requested in the experiments.
Can be run with 

```
$ python filename.py "optional arguments here"
```

simple stuff

The tutorials use a library called PIKA

### Pending issues
None, besides my issues building a simple gradle project in WSL. All sunshine and rainbows

Man i love java....

### Other
also didn't notice the whole 
"the same repository that you created in the earlier .. assignments" 
part, so tell me if its critical that i collapse all my assignments into one git directory
